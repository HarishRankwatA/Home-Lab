# Home Lab – Virtualized Cybersecurity Environment

##  Objective  
Designed a personal cybersecurity lab to simulate network environments, practice ethical hacking techniques, and understand network communications between machines.

##  Tools & Technologies  
- **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 10, Kali Linux  
- **Networking:** NAT Network configuration for internal VM communication

##  Key Activities  
- Connected Windows 10 and Kali Linux virtual machines using NAT networking in a controlled lab setup.  
- Performed port scanning and service enumeration using tools like `nmap` and `netcat`.  
- Captured and analyzed network traffic using `Wireshark` to study TCP/IP behavior.  
- Executed basic attack simulations to understand vulnerability discovery and system response.  
- Practiced system hardening techniques and internal threat modeling.

##  Skills Gained  
- Virtual machine configuration and internal network setup  
- TCP/IP traffic analysis and network troubleshooting  
- Fundamental ethical hacking practices in a safe lab  
- Proficiency in Kali Linux tools (e.g., `nmap`, `netcat`, `whois`)  
- Foundational knowledge in system defense and basic offensive techniques
